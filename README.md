## Testing üß∏ 
Run the following command to execute tests:

1. ```bash
   npm test
   npm test -- testfile.test.ts / .tsx


### Front-End

We have implemented cookies for Login and register since it is a method that works well for login and users. This method works well when you want users to have roles such as Admin, wich in our case we do have. 
 
All use of async and wait is because it is more compatible with Ract

- Components
   - For the layout of the component we have used the methods wich we have learned during our mandatory assigments, we have relied mostly on this, and we used chat for some help. 


- Services
   
      - This layout is taken from the assignments we have had, all the service files therefore follow the same format
      - Angel Service: For creating the version log, and for creating the database, these sources were used (ref src: 4)
      - A similar setup as from the assignments was used in this one, in addition, chatGPT was also used to correct errors

      
- test
   - services
      For all the test we have used async and wait since these are more compatible with react asynchronius behaviour
     

   - components
      For all the test we have used async and wait since these are more compatible with react asynchronius behaviour. 
      For some of the components test we have used act since it has helped with


### Back-end

All use of async and wait is because it is more compatible with React.


- For back-end we have used the JavaScript Date toISOString()-method, wich is used to convert the given data object's contents into a string in ISO format. We chose to use this because it is more compatible with React. Sources we used are (ref src 3)

- src
    - router
        - The format of the router files is taken from the mandatory exercises, but with the router-tests and services-test split up.

    - services
        - The service format is taken from the mandatory exercises, with changes made with login- and register-services: the following sources are used as help to build of  the  structure   for both user and login (ref src 1,2)
- test

   We were not able to use the test methods wich we have learned since React made it very complicated, thats why we had to go and try to find different ways to make these tests. Thats why we had to get a little more help from chat, so that we could use it correctly. We learned to late that we could not use the original test methods, and therefor we did not have te time to go very much in depth and learn the new methods without the help of AI tools.
